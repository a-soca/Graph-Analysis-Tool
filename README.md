# Graph Analysis Tool

This MATLAB script solves and compares user defined linear and quadratic equations.
The line type, number of roots and coordinates are tabulated in the console alongside the plotted graph.
Once the solutions have been evaluated, provided more than one line equation has been entered, the user is presented with the option to select two lines to compare them and find their coordinate(s) of interception which are then plotted on the graph and printed in the console.
